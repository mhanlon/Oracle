# Oracle

A little app for a learning Swift workshop

Follow along during the live session or a recording. There will be branches of the projects in various states, so if you get lost along the way you can switch branches to catch up.


## `starting-point`
This is the bare bones project. Start here if you missed setting up the project.

## `first-ui`
We have added our labels for the ideas our app will generate as well as a button for invoking our logic.

## `outlet-and-action`
Our answerLabel and Create button are connected to code in the form of an IBOutlet and IBAction.

## `added-brain`
We added in a new piece of code to handle generating ideas for us.

## `main`
Our latest and greatest implementation.
